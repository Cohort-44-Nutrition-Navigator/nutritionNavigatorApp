# Nutrition Navigator (Juno WD Bootcamp Project #4)

## About

[Nutrition Navigator](https://nutrition-navigator.netlify.app) is a React app project completed in November 2022 by Anjalee Benedict, Dana Teagle, and Joel Nash as part of the Web Development Bootcamp (Cohort 44).

## Functionality

The app allows users to search the [Nutritionix API](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api) for foods (either branded or generic) and then get nutritional data on those items. It also has functionality that allows for favouriting items for later, and comparing nutrient values of multiple foods in a table. Users can also create an account which they can log in or out of to see their favourite items. We acheived this by using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication and persistent data.
